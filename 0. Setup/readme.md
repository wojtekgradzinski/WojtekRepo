## Important decisions to make
- Which operative system are you using? Pick your guide. [Windows](https://github.com/Strive-School/ai_setup/blob/master/operating_system/WINDOWS.md) | [Ubuntu](https://github.com/Strive-School/ai_setup/blob/master/operating_system/ubuntu.md) | [MacOS](https://github.com/Strive-School/ai_setup/blob/master/operating_system/MacOS.md).
- - We <3 ubuntu but recommend having a windows backup via dualboot o VM to make sure Zoom works well
- If you want to do a Dual Boot or Virtual Machine to have both Windows and Ubuntu, check this [guide](https://github.com/Strive-School/ai_setup/blob/master/operating_system/DualBoot.md)
- Do you want to code in **Jupyter Notebooks** or an **IDE like PyCharm or VSCode**? If you just started coding, we recommend Jupyter at first. 
  - Here is a talk explaining all the [advantages of Jupyter Notebooks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q6sLbz37gk) by Jeremy Howard.
  - Here is another talk explaining all the [perks of an IDE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jiPeIFXb6U) by Joel Grus when it comes to using it for Data Science.
- If you use Jupyter Notebooks, we recommend also installing the [following extensions](https://github.com/Strive-School/ai_setup/blob/master/Jupyter_Packages.md) that will make your life easy

## Side challenge
- What color will your terminal be of? [Windows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sckbApgo4Fk) | [Ubuntu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=li92nChHpCs) | [MacOS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mr0iKqF6WGA).
